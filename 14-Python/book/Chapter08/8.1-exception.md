异常
===

### try...except

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# Filename: try_except.py

import sys

try:
    s = raw_input('Enter something --> ')
except EOFError:
    print '\nWhy did you do an EOF on me?'
    sys.exit() # exit the program
except:
    print '\nSome error/exception occurred.'
    # here, we are not exiting the program

print 'Done'

# $ python try_except.py
Enter something -->
Why did you do an EOF on me?

$ python try_except.py
Enter something --> Python is exceptional!
Done
```

### raise

- 可使用 raise 引发异常，需指名错误或异常的名称及异常对象。

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# Filename: raising.py

class ShortInputException(Exception):
    '''A user-defined exception class.'''
    def __init__(self, length, atleast):
        Exception.__init__(self)
        self.length = length
        self.atleast = atleast

try:
    s = raw_input('Enter something --> ')
    if len(s) < 3:
        raise ShortInputException(len(s), 3)
    # Other work can continue as usual here
except EOFError:
    print '\nWhy did you do an EOF on me?'
except ShortInputException, x:
    print 'ShortInputException: The input was of length %d, \
          was expecting at least %d' % (x.length, x.atleast)
else:
    print 'No exception was raised.'

# $ python raising.py
Enter something -->
Why did you do an EOF on me?

# $ python raising.py
Enter something --> ab
ShortInputException: The input was of length 2, was expecting at least 3

# $ python raising.py
Enter something --> abc
No exception was raised.
```

### try...finally

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# Filename: finally.py

import time

try:
    f = file('poem.txt')
    while True: # our usual file-reading idiom
        line = f.readline()
        if len(line) == 0:
            break
        time.sleep(2)
        print line,
finally:
    f.close()
    print 'Cleaning up...closed the file'

# $ python finally.py
Programming is fun
When the work is done
Cleaning up...closed the file
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "finally.py", line 12, in ?
    time.sleep(2)
KeyboardInterrupt
```

- 上述代码在程序运行的时，按 `Ctrl-c` 中断/取消程序，在程序退出前，finally 从句仍然被执行。
