### 字面常量
- 整形常量：5
- 浮点数常量：1.23, 52.3E-4(`$52.3 * 10^-4$`)
- 字符串常量：'This is a string'，"It's a string!"

### 字符串
- 使用单引号（'）
所有空格和制表符都照原样保留。
```python
'What\'s your name?'

'I realy like "python"!'
```

- 使用双引号（"）
转义字符会进行转义。
```python
"What's your name?"

"I realy like 'python'!"

"hello,\
world"

"hello,\nworld"
```

- 行末的单独一个反斜杠表示字符串在下一行继续，而不是开始一个新的行

```python
"This is the first sentence.\
This is the second sentence."
# 等价于
"This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence."

```

- 使用三引号（'''）
可通过三引号指定一个多行的字符串。三引号中可自由使用单引号和双引号。如：
```python
'''This is a multi-line string. This is the first line.
This is the second line.
"What's your name?," I asked.
He said "Bond, James Bond."
'''

'''hello,
world'''
```
### 变量
```python
binary = "binary"
do_not = "don't"
y = "Those who know %s and those who %s." % (binary, do_not)

print x
print y
# Use the %r for debugging, it displays the "raw" data of the variable
print "I said: %r." % x
print "I also said: '%s'." % y

hilarious = False
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! %r"

print joke_evaluation % hilarious

w = "This is the left side of..."
e = "a string with a right side."

print w + e
```

###Parameters
```python
from sys import argv

script, first, second, third = argv

print "The script is called:", script
print "Your first variable is:", first
print "Your second variable is:", second
print "Your third variable is:", third


$ python ex13.py first 2nd 3rd
# 输出：
The script is called: ex13.py
Your first variable is: first
Your second variable is: 2nd
Your third variable is: 3rd
```

###Prompting and Passing
```python
from sys import argv

script, user_name = argv
prompt = '> '

print "Hi %s, I'm the %s script." % (user_name, script)
print "I'd like to ask you a few questions."
print "Do you like me %s?" % user_name
likes = raw_input(prompt)

print "Where do you live %s?" % user_name
lives = raw_input(prompt)

print "What kind of computer do you have?"
computer = raw_input(prompt)

print """
Alright, so you said %r about liking me.
You live in %r.  Not sure where that is.
And you have a %r computer.  Nice.
""" % (likes, lives, computer)

$ python ex14.py zed
