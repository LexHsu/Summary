列表
===

- 列表是可变的数据类型，而字符串不是。具体见 help(list)。
```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# Filename: using_list.py

# This is my shopping list
shoplist = ['apple', 'mango', 'carrot', 'banana']

print 'I have', len(shoplist),'items to purchase.'

print 'These items are:', # Notice the comma at end of the line
for item in shoplist:
    print item,    # 结尾的逗号用于消除每个 print 语句自动打印的换行符

print '\nI also have to buy rice.'
shoplist.append('rice')
print 'My shopping list is now', shoplist

print 'I will sort my list now'
shoplist.sort()
print 'Sorted shopping list is', shoplist

print 'The first item I will buy is', shoplist[0]
olditem = shoplist[0]
del shoplist[0]
print 'I bought the', olditem
print 'My shopping list is now', shoplist

# $ python using_list.py
